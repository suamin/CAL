## Active Learning - A Case Study with Enron Spam-Ham

In this study we compare and contrast _active learning_ with _supervised learning_ on a toy dataset of Enron spam classification under the framework of _predictive coding_, where the goal is to find _relevant_ documents in large pool of unlabeled and mostly _irrelevant_ documents by learning from human-in-the-loop acting as an _oracle_. The case study is followed by literature review of major active learning techniques (check notebook).
